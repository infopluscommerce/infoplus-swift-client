# infoplus-swift-client
Infoplus is a cloud platform to manage your inventory, orders, warehouse, and shipments.

The Infoplus API exposes the full breadth and depth of the Infoplus platform to all clients.
With the Infoplus API, you can integrate Infoplus functionality into other platforms 
(e.g. your ERP, shopping cart, accounting system, etc.), enabling you to do, in your own platform, 
anything you can do in Infoplus. 

This repository is a native Swift client for full access to the Infoplus API.
